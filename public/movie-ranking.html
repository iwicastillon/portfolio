<h1>The Best Movies According to Aicee</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Vow</h3>
<p>This movie shows that love will always find its way back to you.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>I just love this series for no reason. It's pure magical!</p>

<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This movie is somewhat a package. It shows love, no matter what you are or who you are in life, everybody has the chance to receive that kind of love like Jack and Rose had. I also wanted to mention the selfisness and greediness of one high-class passenger that brought the life of many people into doom. </p>
